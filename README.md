# Python Design Patterns

Design patterns are standard solutions to problems that typically occur in software development. These patterns usually depend on a compiler to enforce and maintain them, however the Python language provides features that make it possible to implement design patterns without a compiler.

This project is doing just that - implementing various design pattners the "Python" way as practice.

### Design Patterns Included

* Abstract Factory 
  * Implemented in the `abstract_factory` folder in the root directory.
  * Demonstrates how to create version independent creator/product objects to facilitate loose coupling to external dependencies.
* Decorator
  * Implemented in the `decorator` folder in the root directory.
  * This pattern (a personal favorite) demonstrates how to attach new behaviors and functionality to objects without modifying the other objects.
* More to come...
